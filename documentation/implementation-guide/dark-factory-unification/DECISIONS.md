# DECISIONS — dark-factory unification implementation log

Append-only. One entry per class-2/3 call made under PLAN.md §C. Format:

```
## <UTC timestamp> · <phase> · class <2|3>
DECISION: <what was decided>
CITED:    <the §C rule / pinned anchor / house pattern relied on>
REVERT:   <the concrete path back if the operator disagrees>
```

Class-3 entries are QUESTIONS batched for the operator — answered defaults,
never blockers. Check this log for precedent before deciding anything: the
same question is never asked (or re-decided) twice.

## 2026-08-29 · plan · class 2 (seed entry, by the planning session)
DECISION: §4's four open decisions resolved to standing defaults — reviewer
          verdict folds into U2; dark-mode is per-anchor; the unified config
          is a shared org.config.json with multiple readers; the cadence
          scheduler is supercronic.
CITED:    §C.3 (operator pre-authorized the recommended defaults, 2026-08-29,
          when granting autonomous execution).
REVERT:   Each is a config or naming change; none is load-bearing until U2+
          lands. Flip the default and re-run the affected phase's validation.

## 2026-08-29 · U1 Phase 0 · class 2
DECISION: The anchor names three bugs in `audit_sink._mirror`; there are FOUR.
          The tool argument is `metadata_extra`, not `metadata`
          (`OB1/integrations/kubernetes-deployment/index.ts:848`, schema at
          `:361`), so the old call would have dropped its provenance even with
          the path fixed. Fixed alongside the other three and covered by a test.
          Also: the anchor calls `x-brain-key` a "wrong auth" bug. It is NOT —
          `x-brain-key` is correct for openbrain-mcp (`index.ts:2053`, and the
          gateway sends the same header upstream at `app.py:142`). It only
          looks wrong against the CLOUD gateway, which we are no longer
          targeting. Anchor amended on the record rather than "fixed" by
          changing a correct header.
CITED:    §C.1 (amend on the record and continue) + §C.2 class 2 (a discovered
          gap; the option consistent with the pinned wire evidence).
REVERT:   Both are one-line changes in `openbrain_client.py`; the tests name
          the exact source lines, so re-verification is a re-read, not a rerun.

## 2026-08-29 · U1 Phase 0 · class 2
DECISION: `ProjectContext.invalidate` became `async` and now clears the durable
          row too. It had ZERO callers, so no signature was broken.
CITED:    §C.2 class 2 — persistence introduced a regression in a method that
          previously worked: clearing only memory would be silently undone by
          the next restart, so "invalidate" would stop invalidating.
REVERT:   Drop `delete_fn` + the `await` and make it `def` again; the durable
          row simply outlives an invalidate, as it would have anyway.

## 2026-08-29 · U1 Phase 0 · class 1/2
DECISION: TWO journal backup sidecars (one per volume), not one covering both.
CITED:    §C.2 class 1 (house pattern) — every entry in
          `restore-from-snapshot.ps1` maps ONE archive to ONE volume. A
          combined archive would have had no mechanical restore path.
          Both are `profiles: ["workers"]`: `check_backups.py` treats a RUNNING
          sidecar with no artifacts as stale, so ungated they would alarm
          precisely when the org is correctly quiesced.
REVERT:   Merge into one sidecar + one archive, and add a restore type that
          extracts subdirectories into separate volumes.

## 2026-08-29 · U1 Phase 0 · class 2
DECISION: Applied the FULL SERVICE-LIFECYCLE checklist, not only the anchor's
          row 7 — the phase adds two CONTAINERS, which triggers CLAUDE.md's
          container rule. Rows deliberately NOT actioned, each with a checked
          reason: row 4 (recovery) — `$Script:AgentOrgServices` lists only
          default-profile services (`ao-worker-*` are absent for the same
          reason); row 5/6 (health probe, watchdog) — no port, no serve route,
          consistent with the existing backup sidecars; row 8
          (`stack-services.json`) — agent-org has NO rows in that file at all,
          so adding only these two would misrepresent the plane.
CITED:    CLAUDE.md container rule + SERVICE-LIFECYCLE; §C.2 class 2 (the
          binding workspace rule outranks the anchor's narrower wording).
REVERT:   Each surface is an additive row; delete the two rows to undo.

## 2026-08-29 · U1 Phase 0 · class 3 (QUESTION, defaulted, not blocking)
DECISION: `AO_OPENBRAIN_URL` placeholders were said to be missing from the root
          `.env.example`. They already exist in `agent-org/docker/.env.example`
          — the file the agent-org project actually reads — with the
          unreachable gateway value. Fixed there; root `.env.example` left
          alone rather than adding keys nothing reads.
CITED:    §C.2 class 3 — no technical winner, the operator may prefer the root
          file to mirror every key. Defaulted to "the file the compose project
          reads" and kept moving.
REVERT:   Add the two keys to the root `.env.example`; nothing consumes them.
