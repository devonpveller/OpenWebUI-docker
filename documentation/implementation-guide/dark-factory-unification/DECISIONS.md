# DECISIONS — dark-factory unification implementation log

Append-only. One entry per class-2/3 call made under PLAN.md §C. Format:

```
## <UTC timestamp> · <phase> · class <2|3>
DECISION: <what was decided>
CITED:    <the §C rule / pinned anchor / house pattern relied on>
REVERT:   <the concrete path back if the operator disagrees>
```

Class-3 entries are QUESTIONS batched for the operator — answered defaults,
never blockers. Check this log for precedent before deciding anything: the
same question is never asked (or re-decided) twice.

## 2026-08-29 · plan · class 2 (seed entry, by the planning session)
DECISION: §4's four open decisions resolved to standing defaults — reviewer
          verdict folds into U2; dark-mode is per-anchor; the unified config
          is a shared org.config.json with multiple readers; the cadence
          scheduler is supercronic.
CITED:    §C.3 (operator pre-authorized the recommended defaults, 2026-08-29,
          when granting autonomous execution).
REVERT:   Each is a config or naming change; none is load-bearing until U2+
          lands. Flip the default and re-run the affected phase's validation.
